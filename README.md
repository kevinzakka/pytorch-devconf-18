## Applied Research in Academia

* Stochastic Weight Averaging: Wider Optima ==> Better Generalizability
* Gaussian Processes = DNNs + Uncertainty (minimal overhead)
* Opt-Net: Inserting Differentiable QP Layers in a DNN to Encode Constraints and Create Richer Representations ==> Can Solve Sudoku
* Using GANs to remove the need to hand-define loss functions, i.e. the discriminator acts as a learned loss function

## Karpathy's Software 2.0

* Version Controlling a Dataset
* Keeping a Model Zoo
* DevOps + CI
* "Curating Your Test Set"

## Catanzaro's Applied ML

* 2 Takeways:
	* Using AI for Assisting Humans in the Creative Process
    * PyTorch for Reducing Idea Generation Latency

**Examples**

* Vid2Vid + Frame Prediction ==> Data Generation for Video Games
* Supersampling (Anti-Aliasing + Superresolution) ==> Better Graphics
* Inpainting ==> Helping the Photo-Editing Process
* Using Mixed Precision for Training Larger and Faster Unsupervised Language Models
    * Apex takes care of automatic casting (e.g. batch norm bad with fp16)
